# NAME
battery - This module reads battery status

# DESCRIPTION

This module reads battery status from _/sys/class/power_supply_ and
uses *udev* to monitor for changes.

Note that it is common (and "normal") for batteries to be in the state
*unknown* under certain conditions.

For example, some have been seen to enter the *unknown* state when
charging and the capacity reaches ~90%. The battery then stays in
*unknown*, rather than *charging*, until it has been fully charged and
enters the state *full*.

This does not happen with all batteries, and other batteries may enter
the state *unknown* under other conditions.

:< *Description*
|  name
:  string
:  yes
:  Battery device name (one of the names in */sys/class/power_supply*)
|  poll-interval
:  int
:  no
:  How often, in milliseconds, to poll for capacity changes
   (default=*60000*). Set to `0` to disable polling (*warning*: many
   batteries do not support asynchronous reporting). Cannot be less
   than 250ms.
|  battery-scale
:  int
:  no
:  How much to scale down the battery charge amount. Some batteries
   report too high resulting in bad discharge estimates
|  smoothing-secs
:  int
:  no
:  How many seconds to perform smoothing over for battery discharge
   estimates.

        name: BAT0
        poll-interval: 30000
        content:
          string: {text: "BAT: {capacity}% {estimate}"}
